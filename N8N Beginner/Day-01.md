## 1.N8N

- AI Automation workflow where we can build Agents.
- Low Code/No-Code.
- Integrated with Third Party Application.
- Self Hosted.


## 2. Architecture of N8N

- Trigger the workflow.
- Perform any action.
- Give the result.

## 3. Difference between Automation and Agent.

- Automation : we can create an automation to check the weather in a particular city.

- Agents : we can create agent to check for the weather in a particular city and also with that we can suggest some new routes and we can check when the rain in going to stop with the help of AI Models.

## 4. Nodes in N8N.

- Using nodes we can perform actions in the workflow.The following nodes are,
- **Trigger Node :** There are different way to trigger the workflow.**E.g** Manual Trigger, schedule trigger, action trigger(form action), based on some message we can trigger, webhook trigger(listen for http request on a particular URL).
- **Action Node :** we can perform action using action nodes.**E.g** Interact with sheets, sending an email, message..all the third party applications.
- **Utility Node :** There are different types of utility nodes.**E.g** If Node, Switch Node, Merge Node, Split Node.
- **Code Node :** we can perform some data manipulations.
- **Agent Node :** we can call an AI Models set an memeory to it.
